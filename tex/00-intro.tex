{\bf Introduction}

Advice for this assignment:
\begin{itemize}
  \item In the context of this assignment, words are simply strings separated
  by whitespace. This includes case and punctuation (e.g. ``great'' and
  ``Great'' are considered different words).

  around in there before you start coding.
