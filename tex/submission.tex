% This contents of this file will be inserted into the _Solutions version of the
% output tex document.  Here's an example:

% If assignment with subquestion (1.a) requires a written response, you will
% find the following flag within this document: 📝_1a
% In this example, you would insert the LaTeX for your solution to (1.a) between
% the 📝_1a flags.  If you also constrain your answer between the
% START_CODE_HERE and END_CODE_HERE flags, your LaTeX will be styled as a
% solution within the final document.

% Please do not use the '📝' character anywhere within your code.  As expected,
% that will confuse the regular expressions we use to identify your solution.

% 📝_1d
\begin{answer}
  % ### START CODE HERE ###
  % ### END CODE HERE ###
